a. Notable Obstacles
    - A notable obstacle for me exact spelling errors. I had to make sure that everything was spelled correctly and didn't have bad punctuation as this was a big part of the spec. A big spelling error for me was institution as I kept writing "instituion".
    - Another notable obstacle was writing the nested if else statement. It was hard for me to see which statement was in which statement but I later wrote my code cleanly so it would work correctly.
    - My last notable obstacle was writing the formula for the basis amount. At first I didn't really get it and it took me a couple tries to get the formula down correctly.
