a. Notable Obstacles
    - This project took me 16+ hours because I didn't know how much to increment word portion by and hyphens tripped me up a lot
    - The hyphens was the hard part because there were many different cases for the hyphens
    - I first had an approach of just making a word list and using the previous word to see what to change however
    I decided that making a second array of booleans to see if the words were connected was better
    - The edge cases in this project were super super hard. There are so many edge cases that I don't think I can finish them all
    that said, I probably won't get full score because I tried to think of as many edge cases as possible
b. Pseudo Code
void clearString (char* arr, int length) {
    loops through each index of the c string 
        makes it a null chracter
}

int arrange(int lineLength, std::istream& in, std::ostream& out) {
    if (length less than 1)
        return 1
    repeatedly get each line of the input:
        loops through the word list and empties it
        loops through the input line letter by letter:
            if the letter is a hyphen
                if were not in a word
                    we're in a word now (inWord bool)
                    we haven't outputted to the word list yet (hadPortion bool)
                adds the hyphen to the word string
                sets the continutation to if we have outputted to the word list yet (true if after a hyphen already)
                output to word list
                clearString
                we've outputted to the word list
            else if the letter is not a space
                if were not in a word
                    we're in a word now
                    we haven't outputted to the word list yet
                adds the letter or puncuation to the word string
            else
                if we were in a word and its not a space or newline
                    output to word list
                    clearString
                we're no longer in a word (inWord bool)
                we haven't outputted to a word list yet (hadPortion bool)
        if we were in a word and its not a space or newline //last word of input line
            output to word list
            clearString
        loops through word list word by word:
            if loop is not on the 1st iteration
                sets previous word to the word before the current index
            if word is a paragraph header
                if previous word is paragraph header
                    go to next iteration
                if we split a word before the paragraph header
                    output only one new line
                else
                    output two new lines
            else
                if length of word is bigger or equal to line length
                    if length of word is bigger than line length
                        returncode is 2
                    if theres output on the line already
                        output new line
                    add the correct amount of spaces
                    loops through the word letter by letter:
                        if we fill the line length
                            output new line
                        output the letter
                else
                    //Spacing
                    if starting word or connected word portions
                        no spaces needed
                    else
                        if ., ?, or :
                            two spaces needed
                        else
                            one space needed
                    if current line index, spaces, and length of word fit line length
                        add spaces
                    else
                        add new line
            if last word of line
                previous word is last word of line
    if we haven't outputted a newline
        output a new line
    return returncode
}   
c. List of Test Data
"------ - so-- - - - - - - what the hell" (length = 5, A bunch of hyphens, this is to make sure hyphens are correctly accounted for)

"Henley-on-Thames" (length = 5, Seperated portion of words, from the spec)

"so--called -s" (length = 3, Seperated portion of words)

"I don't asodbaois
evne know what to say
I thin k I a <p> <p> <p>
am going crazy" (length = 20, Multiple paragraph headers consecutively)

"abcdefghij" (length = 5, input length longer than line length)

"Hi   there--friend.  Bye--now?" (length = 20, mixed puncutation with hyphen)

"what      









the






heck" (length = 20, a bunch of new line characters and spaces to see if word portioning is correct)

"   hello    world   " (length = 20, leading spaces, trailing spaces, and spaces in between)

"     " (any valid length, empty input line, should return nothing and output 0)

"It always does seem to me that I am doing more work than
  I should do. It is not that I object to the work, mind you;
I like work: it fascinates me.       I can sit and look at it for hours.
I love to keep     it by me: the idea of getting
rid
of it nearly breaks my heart. <P> You cannot give me too
much work; to accumulate work has almost become


a passion with me: my study is so full of it now, that there is hardly
an inch of room for any more." (length = 400, insanely long length)

"------ - so-- - - - - - - what the hell -s
so--called		
asdoasihdoi
asoid bvanana? 

ai am the banana" (length = 3, a combination of hyphens, puncutation, spaces, and random letters)
